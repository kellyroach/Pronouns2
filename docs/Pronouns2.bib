%SEMANTICSCHOLAR.ORG didn't report "publisher", but suggested
%"journal = {Research on Language and Social Interaction}".
%However, WWW evidence indicates this is "current" name of
%what was "Papers in Linguistics".
%TODO: Double check publisher.
%ChatGPT now reversing itself and saying
%correct publisher should be the University of Alabama Press
%We can find the paper at
%https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08351817809389177
%but I don't know what that ultimately means for "publisher".
%It could be we should follow ChatGPT's advice and just leave
%publisher's name off of @article citations.  Let's say TBD.
%For now, leave as "publisher = {Taylor \& Francis}".
